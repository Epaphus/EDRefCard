## 1.2.4

## 1.2.3

* Restored caching of rendered JPEGs to one day now that we have more disk space.

## 1.2.2

* Improved the error reporting when there is an error parsing the bindings file.

## 1.2.1

* Added the new bindings introduced in Chapter 4 beta 3.
* Updated the code that prevents redundant specialisations from being shown on the same card (e.g. when GalMap pitch axis is the same as your regular pitch axis). This should make cards more concise w/o loss of clarity.

* Command names are now in Title Case and some have been abbreviated.
* The keyboard chart makes more use of symbols to identify the keys.
* The Galaxy map controls now say "GalMap" rather than "Camera".

## 1.1

* Blocking "spammy" descriptions is as those starting with punctuation.

## 1.0.8

* Added bindings introduced in Chapter 4, notable the FSS scanner.

## 1.0.7

* Fixed errors with non-ASCII file encodings. Should now be fully Unicode.

## 1.0.6

* The list view is now sorted in a case-insensitive manner.
* The home page now correctly uses https to access its style sheet from Google APIs. Thanks to eeisenhart.
